## API Key

Enter your own Google API key in the apikey.ts file.
The Google API key can be retrieved [here](http://console.developers.google.com/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## SSL Certificate

## Development server with SSL

Run `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --ssl 1 --ssl-key "ssl/localhost.key" --ssl-cert "ssl/localhost.crt"` for a dev server with SSL. Navigate to `https://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
